## Resources

## Built With

## Results

* Higher Per Student Budget not necessary lead to a higher grade, for example Cabrera High School, who has the highest passing rate spent less than 600 dollar budget per student, and the bottom 5 school all have budget per student higher than 600 dollar. In addition, schools spent lower than 615 dollar per student has significant (15%) higher scores than over 615 dollar. The highest spending category 645-675 got the lowest score.

* School type matters. All Top 5 school are Charter school, and 5 Bottom schools are District Schools. Overall variance between these two on passing rate are 23%, Charter schools are higher. Charter school performed especially well in math score, the difference on passing rate is 27% (93.62% Charter vs 66.55% District)

* Larger size schools doesnâ€™t show good performance in score, compared to median size and small size school. However once the school size goes below 2000 students, the change are not significant.

* It is pretty consistent on math and reading scores, while grade changes in each individual school.
